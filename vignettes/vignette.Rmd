## Use case

[Describes the problem the App is designed to solve and by whom]

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has led to the global instability of economies, governments, and life as we once knew. Its pervasiveness, exceptional rate of transmission, and virulence are key aspects of why this virus has led to unprecedented levels of fatalities and disruption of everyday life. COVID-19 has left an indelible impact on the world, having entered the top ten of history's worst pandemics, totaling over 2.7 million deaths worldwide.

A phenomenon of this scale necessitates constant surveillance and data analysis to mitigate further fatalities. To that end, a COVID-19 Informational Shiny App could synthesize the troves of data surrounding this pandemic and, among other possibilities, inform users of dispersion across geographic areas, project future mortality rates, and track caseloads.

With the U.S. battling the effects of COVID-19 and given the numerous phases the pandemic has been through, there are many individuals who would like access to COVID-19 and related information that may affect them, their families, and their communities. Information being disseminated about COVID-19 via news outlets and other social media are either too complex for the average individual to digest or marred with sociopolitical sentiment that stands to skew that information with bias.

The purpose of this app is to provide available COVID-19 data and present in a way that offers users concise and valuable answers to everyday questions concerning their safety.

## Data structure

### Provisional COVID-19 Death Counts by Sex, Age, and State

This data set contains rows organized around three different groupings: "By Total", "By Year", and "By Month". Within each of these, data is broken down by state, sex, and age group. For each of state, sex, and age group, there are also "All States", "All Sexes", and "All Age Group" categories.

Each row contains:
* An as-of date for the dataset
* A start date and end date
* Columns for the aforementioned grouping, state, sex, and age group categories
* Counts for the following categories of deaths:
** Total deaths
** One column each for deaths due to only one of COVID-19, influenza, and pneumonia
** One column for deaths due to both COVID-19 and pneumonia
** One column for deaths due to _any of_ COVID-19, influenza, or pneumonia

Rows corresponding to the "By Year" or "By Month" groupings also contain year or year and month values, respectively.
