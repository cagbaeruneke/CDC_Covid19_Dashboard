## Use case

[Describes the problem the App is designed to solve and by whom]

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has led to the global instability of economies, governments, and life as we once knew. Its pervasiveness, exceptional rate of transmission, and virulence are key aspects of why this virus has led to unprecedented levels of fatalities and disruption of everyday life. COVID-19 has left an indelible impact on the world, having entered the top ten of history's worst pandemics, totaling over 2.7 million deaths worldwide.

A phenomenon of this scale necessitates constant surveillance and data analysis to mitigate further fatalities. To that end, a COVID-19 Informational Shiny App could synthesize the troves of data surrounding this pandemic and, among other possibilities, inform users of dispersion across geographic areas, project future mortality rates, and track caseloads.

With the U.S. battling the effects of COVID-19 and given the numerous phases the pandemic has been through, there are many individuals who would like access to COVID-19 and related information that may affect them, their families, and their communities. Information being disseminated about COVID-19 via news outlets and other social media are either too complex for the average individual to digest or marred with sociopolitical sentiment that stands to skew that information with bias.

The purpose of this app is to provide available COVID-19 data and present in a way that offers users concise and valuable answers to everyday questions concerning their safety.

## Data structure

### Provisional COVID-19 Death Counts by Sex, Age, and State

This data set contains rows organized around three different groupings: "By Total", "By Year", and "By Month". Within each of these, data is broken down by state, sex, and age group. For each of state, sex, and age group, there are also "All States", "All Sexes", and "All Age Group" categories.

Each row contains:
* An as-of date for the dataset
* A start date and end date
* Columns for the aforementioned grouping, state, sex, and age group categories
* Counts for the following categories of deaths:
** Total deaths
** One column each for deaths due to only one of COVID-19, influenza, and pneumonia
** One column for deaths due to both COVID-19 and pneumonia
** One column for deaths due to _any of_ COVID-19, influenza, or pneumonia

Rows corresponding to the "By Year" or "By Month" groupings also contain year or year and month values, respectively.


### Case Surveillance Public Use Data

[Describes the general structure of the data.]


### Conditions contributing to deaths involving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), by age group and state, United States.

[Describes the general structure of the data.]

This dataset shows health conditions and contributing causes mentioned in conjunction with deaths involving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Starting December 23, 2020, the data file will also include the number of deaths that mention the listed conditions. The new column, “COVID-19 Deaths” represents the number of deaths that mention one or more of the conditions indicated. The data's existing “Number of Mentions” column represents the number of total conditions mentioned for each age group.

Each row contains:
* date_as_of: Date of Analysis
* start_date: First week-ending date of data period 
* end_date: Last week-ending date of data period
* group: Time-period indicator for record: by Month, by Year, Total
* year: Year in which death occurred
* month: Month in which death occurred
* state: Jurisdiction of occurrence
* condition_group: Condition Group
* condition: Condition contributing to deaths involving COVID-19
* age_group: Age group
* covid_19_deaths: COVID 19 Deaths
* number_of_mentions: Number of mentions

Number of conditions reported in this table are tabulated from deaths received and coded as of the date of analysis and do not represent all deaths that occurred in that period. Data during this period are incomplete because of the lag in time between when the death occurred and when the death certificate is completed, submitted to NCHS and processed for reporting purposes. This delay can range from 1 week to 8 weeks or more. Conditions contributing to the death were identified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10). Deaths involving more than one condition (e.g., deaths involving both diabetes and respiratory arrest) were counted in both totals. To avoid counting the same death multiple times, the numbers for different conditions should not be summated. Deaths with confirmed or presumed COVID-19, coded to ICD–10 code U07.1
